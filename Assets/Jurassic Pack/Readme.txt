    Jurassic Pack
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you for purchasing the Jurassic Pack. This asset contains dino and demo folders,
    dino's folders contains the FBX model with animations and textures.

    The "demo" folder is optional, there is a animation controller which allows you to get an idea of 
    the possible animations transitions.

    It also contains a script in C# allowing dinosaurs to perform moves, control
    bone during animations and play sound.

    The MainCam script is only used to control the camera.

    If you have any, question, suggestion or request, do not hesitate to contact me :) .
